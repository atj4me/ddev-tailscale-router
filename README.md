## Overview

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a VPN service that creates a private and secure network between your devices.

This add-on integrates Tailscale into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com) project. Unlike temporary sharing solutions, this gives you permanent, human-readable URLs that work across all your Tailscale-connected devices.

Read the full blog post: [Tailscale for DDEV: Simple and Secure Project Sharing](https://ddev.com/blog/tailscale-router-ddev-addon/)

## Use Cases

This add-on is particularly useful for:

- **Cross-device testing**: Test your sites on phones, tablets, or other devices without being on the same Wi-Fi network
- **Stable webhook URLs**: Use permanent Tailscale URLs as reliable endpoints for webhooks from payment gateways, APIs, etc.
- **Team collaboration**: Share your development environment with team members to show work in progress
- **Remote development**: Access your local development sites securely from anywhere

## Prerequisites

Before installing the add-on:

1. [Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on any two devices (computer, phone, or tablet). This is required to generate the auth key.
2. [Enable HTTPS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https) in your [DNS settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) by clicking "Enable HTTPS..." (required for TLS certificate generation).
3. [Generate an auth key](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys) in your [Keys settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) (ephemeral, reusable keys are recommended).

    Get the auth key and add it to your environment by updating `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or another relevant shell configuration file with this command:

    ```bash
    echo 'export TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-your-key-here' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set it per project (**NOT RECOMMENDED**, because `.ddev/.env.tailscale-router` is not intended to store secrets) using:

    ```bash
    ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-authkey=tskey-auth-your-key-here
    ```
    
    > **Note:** You can also set up authentication using `ddev tailscale login` after your project starts. This provides secure, interactive access for your DDEV project.

4. **For public access**: Configure your [Access Control List (ACL)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel#funnel-node-attribute) to enable Funnel. Add the `funnel` node attribute to your ACL policy in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls):

    ```json
    {
      "nodeAttrs": [
        {
          "target": ["*"],
          "attr": ["funnel"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router
ddev restart
```

Launch your project's Tailscale URL in browser
```
ddev tailscale launch
```

Or get your project's Tailscale URL
```
ddev tailscale url
```

Your project's permanent Tailscale URL will look like: `https://<project-name>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`. Also, it can be found in your [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).

### Configure Privacy (Optional)

By default, your project is only accessible to devices on your Tailscale network (private mode). This happens automatically when the project starts. You can stop sharing automatically using 
```bash
ddev tailscale stop
```

To make your project publicly accessible (Funnel mode):

```bash
ddev tailscale share --public
```

To revert to private mode (only accessible to your Tailscale devices):

```bash
ddev tailscale share
```

## Usage


Access all [Tailscale CLI](https://tailscale.com/kb/1080/cli) commands plus helpful shortcuts:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ddev tailscale launch [--public]` | Launch your project's Tailscale URL in browser (`--public` uses Funnel mode for public access) |
| `ddev tailscale share [--public]` | Start sharing your project (`--public` uses Funnel mode for public access) |
| `ddev tailscale stop` | Stop sharing |
| `ddev tailscale stat` | Show Tailscale status for self and active peers |
| `ddev tailscale proxystat` | Show Funnel/Serve (proxy) status |
| `ddev tailscale url` | Get your project's Tailscale Funnel URL |
| `ddev tailscale login` | Authenticate with Tailscale interactively |
| `ddev tailscale <any tailscale command>` | Run any Tailscale CLI command in the web container |
